# Reductio

**Reductio** is a Java library aimed at reducing boilerplate code, offering utility tools for functional programming concepts like monads and simplifying common patterns such as null checks (inspired by `Objects.requireNonNull`).

By using Reductio, you can streamline your codebase, improve maintainability, and focus on solving real problems instead of repeating tedious code patterns.

## Features

- **Monads**: Functional programming utilities to simplify data flow and reduce nested logic.
- **Value Checking**: Compact methods to validate arguments and ensure code correctness.
- **Boilerplate Reduction**: Eliminate repetitive patterns with reusable and expressive abstractions.
